# nignogbot

Telegrambot @nignogbot
Crappy nignogbot.js code to be cleaned up, then merge with logger.js 

## Issues / To do

- [] The /mol command does not get 2D molecule png. The jsdom shit is broken because DOM element on pubchem changed somewhere and I'm too retarded to figure it out.

- [] Merge logger.js to a decent clean version of nignogbot.js to get fancy logging nignogbot.

- [] logger.js sometimes appends the same messages or a series of messages repeatedly (seems to happen in busy spammy chats).
